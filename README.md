# Continuous-Authentication-Algorithm

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A Passive Continuous Authentication Algorithm for E- assessment using Handwriting Pressure Measurements.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The aim of this project is to develop an algorithm that ensures that the student taking an assessment is who the person claims to be, 
from the beginning of the assessment to the point of completion, by continuously verifying the studentâ€™s identity beyond the initial
authentication, in a passive, non-intrusive manner, using the writing pressure measurements of the student.
